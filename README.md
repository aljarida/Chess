# Chess

These Python file components allow you to run and play fully-featured command-line chess in your IDE of choice. I developed this project over the course of January 2023 and Summer 2023 to reinforce object-oriented programming principles. It uses a grid-based system initialized with chess piece objects. Letters represent the rank of each piece. Download the files and run the interface.py file to play with it yourself.
