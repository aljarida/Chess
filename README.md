# Chess

These Python file components allow you to run and play command-line chess in your IDE of choice. I developed this project over the course of January 2023
to reinforce object-oriented programming principles. It uses a grid-based system initialized with chess piece objects. Letters represent the rank of each piece.
Numerical inputs for row and column are used to select and move pieces. Download the files and run the interface.py file to play with it yourself.
